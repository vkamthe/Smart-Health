<b>Instructions</b></br>

* Select a 12 lead ECG database (e.g. St. Petersburg INCART Database or PTB Diagnostic ECG database) from Physionet and read the dataset descriptions to identify the heart patient types (e.g MI, CAD, TIA, Other)</br>
* Have a look at the project 3 starter notebook </br>
* load and process the dataset using python WFDB, neurokit, biosppy etc. packages </br>
* read about the different ECG channels and pick the best channel signal e.g. V2, V5 etc. </br>
* divide each ECG record into 1 minute chunks so in total you have 32 x no of hours x 60 ~ 23000 samples </br>
<b>Option 1 (INCART)</b>:</br>
* Develop an articial neural network for multi-category heart disease classification from single channel ECG </br>
* Develop a 1-D convolutional neural network for multi-category heart disease classification from single channel ECG </br>
* Compare the performances of the developed deep learning models </br> 
* Upload/Pull request your notebook on Smart Health course Github Project-3 branch </br>
<b>Option 2 (PTBDB) </b>:</br>
* Develop an articial neural network for myocardial infarction classification from healthy subjects using single channel ECG </br>
* Develop a 1-D convolutional neural network for multi-category heart disease classification from single channel ECG </br>
* Compare the performances of the developed deep learning models </br> 
* Upload/Pull request your notebook on Smart Health course Github Project-3 branch </br>
<b>Option 3 (data_arrhythmia.csv) </b>:</br>
* read the dataset details from here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/arrhythmia
* Develop an articial neural network for arrhythmia classification from healthy subjects using single channel ECG </br>
* Develop a 1-D convolutional neural network for arrythmiya classification from single channel ECG </br>
* Compare the performances of the developed deep learning models </br> 
* Upload/Pull request your notebook on Smart Health course Github Project-3 branch </br>
